## LIRI (Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface)

This it language interpretation applicaiton for command line on node.  This appliation will:
* Find concerts using command of _concert-this_

* Find movie information using command of _movie-this_

## How it works:
1. Open your terminal. I am using Git Bash.

3. Always start with "node". Then input liri.js. Stay on the same line then follow next steps.
